# What Happens When You Type `google.com` in Your Browser and Press Enter

This project is a deep dive into what happens behind the scenes when a user types `https://www.google.com` into their web browser and hits Enter.

It is part of a technical writing exercise that helps demonstrate a solid understanding of web infrastructure, including DNS resolution, firewalls, HTTPS, load balancers, web and application servers, and databases.

## 📄 Blog Post

I wrote a detailed blog post explaining the full journey of an HTTP request, from the browser to the database. The explanation is clear, beginner-friendly, and technically accurate. It covers:

- DNS resolution
- TCP/IP and port usage
- Firewalls
- HTTPS and SSL/TLS handshake
- Load balancing
- Web server (NGINX)
- Application server
- Database interaction

## 🗺️ Diagram

To visually represent the request flow, I also created a diagram that illustrates each step of the process. You can see the diagram embedded in the blog post, and you can also access the full version here:
